# Tuning Optimizer & TE Temperament Measures Calculator

- `tuning_optimizer.py`

Optimizes tunings. Custom order, constraints and stretches are supported. 

- `te_temperament_measures.py`

Analyses tunings and computes TE temperament measures from the temperament map. Requires the above module. 

- `et_sequence_error.py`

Finds the ET sequence from the comma list. Can be used to find optimal patent vals. Requires the above module. 

- `complexity_spectrum.py`

Finds the complexity spectrum from the temperament map. 

See `examples.py` for more documents.
